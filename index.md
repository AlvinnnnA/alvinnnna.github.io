Welcome to my personal website! I am a dedicated researcher with a Bachelor's degree in Accounting from Nankai University and currently pursuing a Master's in Economics at The University of Hong Kong. With a passion for organizational behavior and strategic management, I have actively contributed to research projects focused on corporate political activity, innovation, and human resource practices.

I have presented my research at global conferences such as AIB and AOM and have experience in both traditional and novel empirical methods, such as Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA). As I prepare for my next step, I am applying for a PhD in Strategic Management, aiming to further my research into corporate governance and stakeholder dynamics.

Feel free to explore my projects and get in touch!

Sidenote on my name: Although it may seem like my last name is "A", that is not the case. I am a Mongolian-Chinese, member of the Mongolian ethnic minority in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China. Our naming convention generally don't include last name in our names, thus the "correct" version of my name is "Asihan". (although I don't really mind correctness).

However, one singular name causes trouble sometimes, such as some airlines banning me from boarding. As a result, my family decided to break up my name into two parts in all my official documents, hence the separation. In reality, I have been addressed with "Sihan" more often and I absolutely don't mind it. Thank you for reading to this part ; )
