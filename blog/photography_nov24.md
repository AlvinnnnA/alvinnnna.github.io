# The equipments 
I have a [Canon EOS 5](https://global.canon/en/c-museum/product/film159.html) film SLR as my main camera and an [EOS RP](https://global.canon/en/c-museum/product/dslr880.html) as my second (digital) camera (I use it way less frequently than the film camera though).

For lens, I have an EF 28-105mm *f*3.5-4.5 and an EF 50mm *f*1.4, both from second-hand market for *really* discounted price. 

For film processing, I send them out for development and scan on my own. I own a [Nikon LS-50ED (Coolscan VED)](https://www.filmscanner.info/en/NikonCoolscan5ED.html). At ~440 USD second-hand it's a bargain for the quality of scan. It produces 24MP high-quality scans with auto-exposure and autofocus. Negative Lab Pro is my tool for digital processing.
